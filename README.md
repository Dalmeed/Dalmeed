Hi, I’m @Dalmeed
- I’m interested in effective coding in python as a means to grapple with data centric problems
- I’m currently learning... (Yep, that pretty much sums it up)
- I’m looking to collaborate on interesting projects that help people to connect with and build meaningful relationships by doing small things well
- How to reach me ...
